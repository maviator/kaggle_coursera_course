Before preparing to submit the assignment, pay attention to the following criterions. Try to complete most of them and present results in a form that can be easily assessed.

Clarity

-The clear step-by-step instruction on how to produce the final submit file is provided
-The code runs without errors in Kaggle's docker
-Code has comments where it is needed and meaningful function names
-Feature preprocessing and generation with respect to models

-Several simple features are generated
-For non-tree-based models preprocessing is used
-Feature extraction from text and images

-Features from text are extracted
-Special preprocessings for text are utilized (TF-IDF, stemming, levenshtening...)


EDA

-Several interesting observations about data are discovered and explained
-Target distribution is visualized, time trend is assessed


Validation

-Type of train/test split is identified and used for validation
-Model is retrained on all data before a submission
-Type of public/private split is identified


Data leakages

-Data is investigated for data leakages and investigation process is described
-Found data leakages are utilized


Metrics optimization

-Correct metric is optimized


Advanced Features I: mean encodings

-Mean-encoding is applied
-Mean-encoding is set up correctly, i.e. KFold or expanding scheme are utilized correctly


Advanced Features II

-At least few features from this topic are introduced


Hyperparameter tuning

-Parameters of models are roughly optimal


Ensembles

-Ensembling is utilized or absence of necessity in it is shown
-Validation with ensembling scheme is set up correctly, i.e. KFold or Holdout is utilized
-Models from different classes are utilized (at least three from the following: KNN, linear models, RF, GBDT, NN)
